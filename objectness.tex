% \textit{ImageNetModel} represents the ImageNet pre-trained model;
% \textit{FromScratch} indicates that the representation is randomly initialization using Xavier Initialization;
\textit{CompleteCategory} is the model pre-trained to segment the other 15 categories from the PASCAL VOC2011 dataset; The \textit{PixelObjectness} model was pre-trained to distinguish the instance against the background; The \textit{RandomCategory} model was pre-trained to segment instances with randomly assigned categories from 1 to 15.}
