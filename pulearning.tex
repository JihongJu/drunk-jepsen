\section{Positive and Unlabeled Learning}
\label{sec:pulearning}

\textit{One sentence summary of Positive and Unlabeled Learning}

%%%%%%%% TEXT PU Learning setup

\paragraph{Formulation}
\noindent
\textit{This part should explain the Positive and Unlabeled Learning setup with mathematical representation when necessary.}


%%%%%%%% TEXT Modeling
\paragraph{Weighted Logistic Regression}
\noindent
\textit{This part should discuss the linear model for observing positive conditioning on true positive and its relationship to changing the class weight.}


%%%%%%%% TEXT Exponential loss
\paragraph{Exponential Loss for unlabeled examples}
\noindent
\textit{This part should explain why the exponential loss could perform better than the cross-entropy loss, potentially with a figure of 2D Gaussians.}


%%%%%%%% TEXT Expontial loss FADE IN
\noindent
\textit{This paragraph should explain why fade-in was introduced to avoid all-positive inital prediction}


%%%%%%%% TEXT Imbalanced
\noindent
\textit{This part should explain the influence of the imbalanced problem and how to overcome.}

   \caption{2D moons dataset with non-linear separable decision boudary. Four hundreds samples per class were drawn randomly from two interleaving half circles with noises added with a minor standard deviation. A \textbf{red circle} indicates an example labelled as positive whilst a \textbf{blue square} indicates the example has a negative label. The \textbf{leftmost} figures have complete positive labels, meaning the positive and negative labels are all correct, whereas, in \textbf{the other figures} only half of the positives were correctly labelled and the rest were mixed with the negative samples. The \textbf{background colors} represent the probability for the area to be positive given by the classifier trained with the given samples and labels: \textbf{red} for high probability areas, \textbf{blue} for low probability areas and \textbf{white} for the class transition areas, i.e.decision boundaries. The \textbf{size of the markers} in the top row denotes the per-class normalized training losses and the \textbf{size of the markers} in the bottom row the per-class normalized derivatives w.r.t the output of the last layer for the trained Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with the different losses.}
