\paragraph{PU Learning}

A training set for the positive and negative (PU) learning problems contains only a set of positive examples (P set) and a set of unlabeled samples (U set).
Unlabeled examples can be either positive or negative, meaning that there is no reliable negative examples available
One straightforward way to generate negative examples for training is to treat all the unlabeled examples as a set of negative examples with noises.
The problem then converts to learning with clean positive labels and noisy negative labels.
The goal of solving a PU learning problem is to learn a classifier that predicts as many positives as possible while keeping the false positive rate low, regardless the influence of false negative labels.
In other words, the purpose is to achieve high recall without sacrificing too much precision.

%%%%%%%% TEXT Weighted loss for negatives
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\paragraph{Weighted logistic loss}

The mislabeled negative samples bias the classifier to have low recall.
It is possible to balance precision and recall by simply weighing the positive and negative examples differently, namely, let the positive and negative examples have different rates of contribution to the total loss.
Suppose a logistic loss is used, the corresponding weighted loss for a input-output pair $(x, y)$ for a classifier determined by parameters $\theta$ is:
\[
  l(x, y; \theta) =
    \begin{cases}
      - \alpha \log P(y=+1 \vert x; \theta), & y = +1 \\
      - \beta \log P(y=-1 \vert x; \theta), & y = -1
    \end{cases}
\]
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are weights for positive and negative class respectively, and $P(y\vert x; \theta)=\sigma(f(x; \theta))$ is the probablistic predictions by model $f(\cdot)$, activated by the sigmoid function $\sigma(\cdot)$.
This loss is referred to as the \textbf{weighted loss} in the rest of paper.
Empirically, the choice of $p$, $q$ can be made based on the highest precision and recall achieved on a validation set, or alternatively based on a class priors estimation\cite{du2014class}.
% Alternatively, one can also roughly assign $q=p(y=-1 \vert \tilde{y}=-1)$.
% This turns out to be part of the backward corrected loss proposed in  \cite{patrini2016making}:
% \begin{equation*}
%   \begin{aligned}
%     l_{\tilde{y_i}=-1} = - p(y_i=-1 \vert \tilde{y_i}=-1) \log p(y_i=-1 \vert x_i) \\ - p(y_i=+1 \vert \tilde{y_i}=-1) \log p(y_i=+1 \vert x_i)
%   \end{aligned}
% \end{equation*}
% % $$p( \tilde{y} \vert x, y) = \sum_{y}p(\tilde{y} \vert y)p(y \vert x)$$
% % $$p(y=+1 \vert \tilde{y}=+1) = 1 $$
% % $$p(y=-1 \vert \tilde{y}=+1) = 0 $$
% with $p(y_i=-1 \vert \tilde{y_i}=-1) = q$ and $p(y_i=+1 \vert \tilde{y_i}=-1) = 1-q$.



%%%%%%%% TEXT sigmoid Negative loss
\paragraph{Sigmoid Loss for the negative class}

As motivated in Section \ref{sec:related}, we used a class-dependent loss to down-weight the loss contribution of very positive predictions negative labels and still making full use of the clean positive labels.
The loss of positive examples is still a normal logistic loss and the loss of negative examples is replaced with a sigmoid loss \cite{tax2016class}:
\[
  l(x, y; \theta) =
    \begin{cases}
      - \log P(y=+1 \vert x; \theta), & y = +1 \\
      1 - P(y=-1 \vert x; \theta), & y = -1
    \end{cases}
\]
We called this class-dependent loss \textbf{sigmoid loss} in a sense it uses a sigmoid function as the loss of negative samples.
Using the logistic loss for the positive class and the sigmoid loss for the negative class is an interpretation of the prior knowledge that the positive labels are reliable whereas the negative labels are not.

Figure \ref{fig:losses} shows the differences in losses and derivatives with respect to model output between weighted logistic loss and sigmoid loss.
The main feature of sigmoid loss for negative examples is its small changes in the region of confident positive, compared to the weighted loss with $\alpha=1$ and $\beta=0.5$.
As a consequence, the corresponding derivative decreases to zero as the model prediction increases in the positive direction.


%%%%%%%% TEXT Bootstrapping
\paragraph{Hard bootstrapping loss for the negative class}
In addition to the proposed sigmoid loss, we also modify the hard bootstrapping loss by Reed et al. \cite{reed2014training} for PU learning to set a benchmark.
The modified class-dependent hard bootstrapping loss a pair of inputs and label $(x,y)$ is:
% $$l_- = - \beta \log p(y=-1 \vert x) - (1-\beta) \sum_{j\in \{-1, +1\}} p(y=j \vert x) \log p(y=j \vert x)$$
\begin{equation*}
\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{$
  l(x, y; \theta) =
    \begin{cases}
      - \log P(y=+1 \vert x; \theta), & y = +1 \\
      - \beta \log P(y=-1 \vert x;\theta) - (1-\beta) \log P(y=\hat{y} \vert x;\theta), & y = -1
    \end{cases}
$}
\end{equation*}
where $\hat{y} = \argmax_{j\in\{-1,+1\}}{P(y=j \vert x)}$ is the class with the highest predicted probability and $0<\beta<1$.
The first term of the objective is a weighted logistic loss and the second term can be considered as a regularization term to encourage consistent predictions.
This loss is referred as \textbf{bootstrapping loss} for the rest of this paper.
% \begin{equation*}
%   \begin{aligned}
%     H = - \sum_{j\in\{-1,+1\}} p(y_i=j \vert x_i) \log p(y_i=j \vert x_i) \\
%     \sim - \sum_{j\in\{-1,+1\}} \delta(y_i - \hat{y_i}) \log p(y_i=j \vert x_i)
%   \end{aligned}
% \end{equation*}
% which intuitively encourages the model to make confident predictions \cite{grandvalet2005semi}.

%%%%%%%% TEXT Segmentation
\paragraph{Extending PU learning from classification to segmentation}
In Section \ref{introduction}, we argue that learning with unlabeled foreground pixels is similar to a PU learning setup.
Howvever, there is still differences between learning with unlabeled foreground pixels and learning with positive and unlabeled examples.

The first difference is that each example in the normal PU learning setup is independent of each other, whereas pixels in images are not.
Assuming the probability of mislabeling foreground pixel as the background is independent of its neighbor pixels, the classification losses can be applied to segmentation problems by performing per-pixel classification problems.

Another difference between incomplete segmentation and a normal positive and unlabeled learning problem is that pixels for objects of various categories can be unlabeled.
Supposing there are $K$ categories of interest, varying from class $1$ to class $K$, the class $0$ is for unlabeled data which may or may not belong to the $K$ defined categories.
The sigmoid loss can be extended train deep learning models with unlabeled examples from various categories:

\[
  l(x, y; \theta) =
    \begin{cases}
      - \alpha_1 \log P(y=1 \vert x; \theta), & y = 1 \\
                                              & \vdots \\
      - \alpha_K \log P(y=K \vert x; \theta), & y = K \\
      \beta (1 - P(y=0 \vert x; \theta)), & y = 0
    \end{cases}
\]
where $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_K, \beta$ are weighting factors, and $P(y \vert x; \theta)$ is the predictied probability for class $y$, i.e., model output activated by the softmax function.
This loss is referred to as the \textbf{softmax loss} because it uses a softmax activation for the model output.

% Similar modifications can be made to the cross-entropy loss, namely, keeping the losses for classes $1$ to $K$ unchanged and applying the loss for negative class to the loss for class 0, supposing there are $K$ positive classes and one negative class.
% Alternatively, one can apply a one-vs-all strategy, with which the normal logistic loss is used for positive classes while the weighted, sigmoid and bootstrapping loss can be used for the negative class.

%%%%%%%% TEXT Expontial loss FADE IN
\paragraph{Implementation details}
We introduced the sigmoid loss only after training with a class-weighted cross entropy loss for a few epochs.
The sigmoid loss of negative examples saturates for very positive outputs, meaning that the confident, positive prediction has little contribution to the weights update.
The wrong confident predictions can introduce problems at the beginning of the training procedure when the confident predictions are likely to be made at random.
Otimization would reach the plateau when the model made all positive predictions with high confidence.
Besides, we also introduce the modified hard bootstrapping loss only after a few epochs trained with class-weighted loss because it also relies on a nonrandom model for sufficiently reliable prediction $\hat{y}$.


%%%%%%%% TEXT Imbalanced

Another problem encountered in the PU learning setup is the class imbalance introduced by negatively labeled positive samples.
A balanced dataset can become imbalanced in the presence of false negative labels, especially if only a small portion of positive samples are correctly labeled.
We reweighed positive and negative samples based on their occurrences of the observed labels to alleviate the influence of imbalance for training.
Note that the class-weighted logistic loss reweighed the classes in addition to this frequency balancing class weight.
