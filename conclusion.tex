\section{Conclution}
\label{sec:conclution}


\begin{itemize}
  \item Feature transferability is robust to mis-segmentation but not to misclassification and inexhaustive segmentation.
  \item Misclassification noises can be alleviated by binarizing/categorizing classes.
  \item Inexhausitive segmentation can be translated as learning with only  positive and unlabeled examples.
  \item We proposed a class dependent loss to not over-punish confident positive predictions in the presence of noisy negative labels, and it showed slightly better results than class-weighted loss.
\end{itemize}
