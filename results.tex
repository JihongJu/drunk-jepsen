\subsection{Impact of segmentation noises on feature transferability}
\noindent \textit{To summarize the impact of segmentations on feature transferability}
Given the mis-segmentation robustness of feature transferability discussed in section \ref{subsec:robustness}, we proposed to include mis-segmented objects for pre-training.


Pixel independent noise assumption
Logistic loss optimize accuracy, not mean IU
