\section{Evaluation metrics}

(overall) accuracy
$$ \text{accuracy} = \frac{\text{true pos. + true neg.}}{\text{true pos. + false pos. + true neg. + false neg.}}$$

precision
$$\text{precision} = \frac{\text{true pos.}}{\text{true pos. + false pos.}}$$

recall
$$\text{recall} = \frac{\text{true pos.}}{\text{true pos. + false neg.}}$$

f1-score
$$F_1 = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{precision} \cdot \text{recall}}{\text{precision}+\text{recall}}$$

intersection over union (IU)
$$ \text{IU} = \frac{\text{true pos.}}{\text{true pos. + false pos. + false neg.}}$$
