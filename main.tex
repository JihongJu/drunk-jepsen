%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}

Transferring pre-trained representations is widely adopted by convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation because the training data is often available only on a small scale.
In domains where directly adapting classification networks is challenging, we propose to train representations with segmentation datasets containing mislabeled objects and unsegmented objects.
Our experiments demonstrate that both mislabeled segments and incomplete segmentation lower the fine-tuning performance of the learned representations.
To get rid of the negative effect of objects label noises, we propose to assign objects of any categories a foreground label instead of the exact object categories.
Learning representations by segmenting foreground and background turns out to improve the fine-tuning performance significantly when label noises are dominant in the pre-training data.
In the existence of unsegmented objects, a sigmoid loss for the background class is proposed to achieve high recall while keeping the precision better than simply weighting the classes.
The proposed class dependent, sigmoid (or softmax) loss achieves both better pre-training performance and better fine-tuning performance than the class-weighted loss in the presence of incomplete segmentation.

% In some domains of interest, there exist noisy segmentations in addition to a limited amount of perfect segmentations.
% Noisy segmentations can, for instance, come from crowdsourcing platforms.
% The existence of noisy datasets motivates us to consider if it is possible to utilize noisy segmentations in training better image segmentation models with limited training samples.
% We focus on to pre-train robustly transferable feature representations with potentially incomplete, mislabeled segmentations.
% In this paper, we investigate the influence of these segmentation noises on model transferability in an experimental setup with synthesized noises.
% With observing a negative impact of objects mislabeling on feature transferability, we discover that combining object categories as one foreground class improves feature transferability for a small training set corrupted heavily with random labels.
% Besides, a sigmoid loss for the background class is proposed to balance precision and recall when training with incomplete segmentations.
% % Compared to simply changing class weights, the proposed sigmoid loss down-weights the losses for confident predictions and unconfident predictions differently.
% Experiments demonstrate that replacing the cross-entropy loss with a sigmoid loss for the background class achieves better pre-training and fine-tuning performances in the presence of incomplete segmentation.
