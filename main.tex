%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}

The existence of noisy datasets motivates us to study if we can make use of them to pre-train models for image segmentation.
We invested in this work the influence of segmentation noises on transferability of pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) models.
We discovered binarizing classes as foreground and background can improve feature transferability for a small training set corrupted heavily with random labels.
A class-dependent modification to the cross-entropy loss was proposed to balance precision and recall in the presence of unsegmented objects of interest by down-weighting the loss of confident predictions.
