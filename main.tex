%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT

% Noisy data exists
% Transfer learning
% Noises affect feature transferability
% Binarizing classes
% Modify loss for incomplete segmentation

The broad existence of noisy datasets motivates us to consider if it is possible to utilize noisy segmentations in training better image segmentation models with limited training samples.
We investigated in this work how to pre-train convolutional neural network (CNN) models with potentially incomplete, mislabeled segmentations.
The influence of segmentation noises on model transferability was investigated in an experimental setup with synthesized segmentation noises.
With the same setup, we discovered that binarizing classes as foreground and background could improve feature transferability for a small training set corrupted heavily with random labels.
A class-dependent modification to the cross-entropy loss was proposed to balance precision and recall for training with incomplete segmentations.
Compared to simply changing class weights, the proposed sigmoidal loss down-weights the losses for confident predictions and unconfident predictions differently.
Experiments demonstrated that replacing the cross-entropy loss with a sigmoidal loss for background class provide an improvement to both pre-training and fine-tuning performance in the presence of incomplete segmentation.\end{abstract}
