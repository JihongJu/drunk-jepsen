%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}

% Noisy data exists

% Noises affect feature transferability
% Binarizing classes
% Modify loss for incomplete segmentation

In some domains of interest, there exist noisy segmentations in addition to a limited amount of perfect segmentations.
Noisy segmentations can, for instance, come from crowdsourcing platforms.
The existence of noisy datasets motivates us to consider if it is possible to utilize noisy segmentations in training better image segmentation models with limited training samples.
We focus on to learn robustly transferable feature representations with potentially incomplete, mislabeled segmentations.
In this work, we investigate the influence of these segmentation noises on model transferability in an experimental setup with synthesized noises.
With observing a negative impact of objects mislabeling on feature transferability, we discover that combining object categories as one foreground class improves feature transferability for a small training set corrupted heavily with random labels.
Besides, a sigmoidal loss for the background class is proposed to balance precision and recall when training with incomplete segmentations.
% Compared to simply changing class weights, the proposed sigmoidal loss down-weights the losses for confident predictions and unconfident predictions differently.
Experiments demonstrate that replacing the cross-entropy loss with a sigmoidal loss for the background class achieves better pre-training and fine-tuning performances in the presence of incomplete segmentation.
